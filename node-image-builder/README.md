# VM/Node Image Builder

Most of what is here is probably throw-away, but gets us what we need now ahead of things like:

* Google Cloud interconnect
* Some dedicated hardware for running QEMU/KVM builds, so something that supports building QCOW images

The way this image serves its purpose is a bit inefficient right now considering, but we'll switch it around when we can
